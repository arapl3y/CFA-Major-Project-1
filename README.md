### The Process

My goal for this project was to create a clean, minimal and modern portfolio page. I took my previous portfolio design and replaced images with colour gradients, straight lines with skewed lines and a number of other alterations to create an equal parts pleasing and engaging experience for the user.

Most of my design choices were made after compiling a small check list on paper...

I also used Trello to make sure I kept to my original plan and was fulfilling the outcomes I had set the project...

### The Design

My favourite example of engaging, pleasant web design at the moment is https://stripe.com so naturally when given the task of revamping my own website, I took a lot of inspiration from [https://dribbble.com/bdc](Benjamin de Cock's) designs.

Two of my biggest shifts in design were using an animated colour gradient for backgrounds and condensing my introduction blurb translations into one flippable card. I used [https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip](David Walsh's CSS Flip) guide and [https://www.gradient-animator.com/](Ian Forrest's Gradient Animator) to bring these ideas to fruition.

[https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-freelancer/](Start Bootstrap's Freelancer Theme) was also crucial in determining my overall layout.
